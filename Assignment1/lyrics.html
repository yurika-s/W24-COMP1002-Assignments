    <blockquote cite="https://www.kkbox.com/sg/en/song/WmKnEcMnZLaw4PpqLb">
        <p>Of all the things I believe in</p>
        <p>I just want to get it over with</p>
        <p>tears from behind my eyes</p>
        <p>but I do not cry</p>
        <p>Counting the days that past me by</p>
        <br> <!-- One line margin after each section -->
        <p>I've bOen searching deep down in my soul</p>
        <p>Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old</p>
        <p>Looks like I'm starting all over again</p>
        <p>The last three years were just pretend and I say</p>
        <br>
        <p>Goodbye to you</p>
        <p>Goodbye to everything I thought I knew</p>
        <p>You were the one I love</p>
        <p>The one thing that I tried to hold on to</p>
        <br>
        <p>I still get lost in your eyes</p>
        <p>And it seems like I can't live a day without you</p>
        <p>Closing my eyes till you chase my thoughts away</p>
        <p>To a place where I am blinded by the light but it's not right</p>
        <br>
        <p>Goodbye to you</p>
        <p>Goodbye to everything I thought I knew</p>
        <p>You were the one I loved</p>
        <p>The one thing that I tried to hold on to</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ohhh yeah</p>
        <p>It hurts to want everything & nothing at the same time</p>
        <p>I want whats yours and I want whats mine</p>
        <p>I want you but I'm not giving in this time</p>
        <br>
        <p>Goodbye to you</p>
        <p>Goodbye to everything I thought I knew</p>
        <p>You were the one I loved</p>
        <p>The one thing that I tried to hold on to</p>
        <p>The one thing that I tried to hold on to</p>
        <br>
        <p>Goodbye to you</p>
        <p>Goodbye to everything I thought I knew</p>
        <p>You were the one I loved</p>
        <p>The one thing that I tried to hold on to</p>
        <br>
        <p>We the stars fall and I lie awake</p>
        <p>Your my shooting star</p>
